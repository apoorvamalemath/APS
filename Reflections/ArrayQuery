Lookup Table
•	Space complexity = n^2
•	Time complexity = n^2 (i.e. processing time)
•	Fetching time = O(1) as we can directly go to the required index.

Square root Decomposition
•	Quicker as we split the number of elements into sqrt(n) parts.
•	Processing time = O(n)
•	Efficiency i.e. access time = O(sqrt(n))
•	Only if the entire block is covered we can pick, else we need to iterate through the entire array again.

Segment tree
•	Space Complexity = 4n
•	Processing time = O(n)
•	Fetching time = O(log(n))
•	Populated in bottom up fashion
•	Once the segment tree is constructed, we cannot change the structure.
