BINOMIAL CO-EFFICIENT

Array Implementation:
•	1D array can be used to just attain the final result. 
Time complexity = n
•	2D array implementation (DP table) provides all the steps i.e intermediate results can be seen.
Result of any intermediate steps can be fetched with no trouble.
Time complexity = n*k
Uses more space (n*k)

Recursion
•	Good for smaller numbers.
•	Inefficient as each it has to recursively compute for all values and cannot go back to fetch any value.
•	Time complexity = O(2^n)
•	Space complexity = (2^n-1)*8bytes
